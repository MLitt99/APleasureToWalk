## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions
- **Single Page Approach**: Successfully implemented a single HTML file with sections for smooth transitions between "pages"
- **Mobile-First Design**: Implemented responsive design with mobile-first approach as specified in requirements
- **Local Storage for Demo**: Implemented browser local storage for booking data in the demo version
- **Stripe for Payments**: Integrated Stripe for payment processing with test mode functionality

### Current Decisions
- **Placeholder Images**: Using placeholder icons for the image carousel until actual dog photos are available
- **Calendar Implementation**: Using Vanilla JS Datepicker with custom styling for the booking calendar
- **Animation Strategy**: Using Intersection Observer API for efficient scroll-based animations
- **Form Validation**: Implementing client-side validation for all form inputs

### Future Considerations
- Potential addition of a backend system for production use
- Expansion of booking system to handle different service types
- Integration with email notification system
- Addition of customer account functionality
- Implementation of a blog or news section

## Known Issues
- Image carousel currently uses placeholder icons instead of actual dog images
- Stripe integration is in test mode and would need to be configured with actual API keys for production
- No server-side validation for the booking form (using client-side only for the demo)
- No actual email notifications are sent upon booking confirmation
